# How to start tunnel for automation test in Mocha-js on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Mocha-js-tunnel)

If you want to run your an automation test in Pytest on LambdaTest using the tunnel and want to start the tunnel automatically in the script, you can use the follwing steps. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Mocha-Selenium-sample).

## Steps

### Step 1: Download the LT tunnel binary from LT Dashboard

Go to your LambdaTest dashboard and click the configure tunnel button on the top right corner and use the download link to download the binary file. 

### Step 2: Code to run LT tunnel before test

The tunnel should be started before test case execution and end after completion. To achieve this, tunnel can be started in the `before` function in the `describe` method like so:

```js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
describe("Mocha Todo Test " + caps.browserName, function() {
    var driver;
    this.timeout(0);
  
    //execute tunnel binary
    before(function(done) {
        let st = "./LT --user " + LT_USERNAME + " --key "+LT_ACCESS_KEY;
        exec(st, (err, stdout, stderr) => {
            if (err) {
              // node couldn't execute the command
              return;
            }
          
            // the *entire* stdout and stderr (buffered)
            console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
            console.log(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
          });
    });
    //placeholder, write this function according to your test
    beforeEach(function(done) {done();});
  
    it("testcase", function(done) {
      //execute test case
    });
  
    //placeholder, write this function according to your test
    afterEach(function(done) {done();});

  });
```
### Step 3: Set tunnel capability to True

Add the `"tunnel": true`  capability in your test file:
In `conf/single.conf.js` file, you need to update your capabilities. 

```js
exports.capabilities = {
        'build': 'Mocha-Selenium-Sample', //Build name
        'name': 'Your Test Name', // Test name
        'platform':'Windows 10', // OS name
        'browserName': 'chrome', // Browser name
        'version': 'latest', // Browser version
        'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
        'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
        'console':false, // To capture console logs.
        'tunnel': true, // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
};
```


## Run your test

```bash
npm run single
```
